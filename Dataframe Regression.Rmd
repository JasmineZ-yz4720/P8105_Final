## Player Age Variable Data Manipulation

```{r}
age_player_df = player_df  |> 
 mutate(age = as.numeric(as.character(age)),
 min = as.numeric(as.character(min)))  |> 
 na.omit()

q25 <- quantile(age_player_df$age, 0.25)
q75 <- quantile(age_player_df$age, 0.75)
q25
q75
mean(age_player_df$age)

proportion_age_23_29 <- age_player_df  |> 
  group_by(team) |>                        # Group by squad
  summarise(
    total = n(),                            # Calculate the total number of players in each squad
    count_23_29 = sum(age >= 23 & age <= 29) # Count the number of players aged between 23 and 29
  )  |> 
  mutate(proportion = count_23_29 / total)

match_df <- match_df  |> 
  left_join(proportion_age_23_29, by = "team")  |> 
  select(-total, -count_23_29)  |> 
  rename(ave_age_proportion=proportion)
```

## Player Region Distribution Data Manipulation

```{r}
GBR_df = country_code_df |> 
  filter(country == "ENG,NIR,SCO,WAL") 
GBR_df = data.frame(country = unlist(strsplit(as.character(GBR_df$country), ",")),
                    official_name_en = GBR_df$official_name_en,
                    region_name = GBR_df$region_name)
country_code_df = country_code_df |> 
  select(country, official_name_en, region_name) |> 
  bind_rows(GBR_df)

player_dist = player_df |>
  separate(nation, into = c("country_abbre", "country"), convert = TRUE) |> 
  select(country, player, team) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = country_code_df) |> 
  drop_na()
```


```{r}
player_region = player_dist |>
  group_by(team) |>                       
  summarise(
    total = n()) 
player_europe = player_dist |>
  filter(region_name == "Europe") |> 
  group_by(team) |>                       
  summarise(
    n_europe = n()) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = player_region) |> 
  mutate(proportion = n_europe/total)

match_df <- match_df  |> 
  left_join(player_europe, by = "team")  |> 
  select(-total, -n_europe)  |> 
  rename(europe_player_proportion = proportion)
```
